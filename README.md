This Jupyter Notebook provides a step-by-step guide to create an Alexa/Google Assistant clone using the ChatGPT API for natural language processing, Gradio for building a simple web-based interface, and Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) services to enable voice interactions.

## Overview

This project aims to create a voice-enabled virtual assistant that can respond to user queries, provide useful information, and engage in natural language conversations. It utilizes the GPT-3.5-based ChatGPT API from OpenAI to process user input and generate appropriate responses. Gradio is used to build an intuitive web interface that allows users to interact with the virtual assistant. The system integrates Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) capabilities to enable voice input and output functionality.

## Technologies Used

1. **Python:** The primary programming language used for building the virtual assistant and handling backend functionality.

2. **OpenAI ChatGPT API:** The API provides natural language processing capabilities to understand user queries and generate responses.

3. **Gradio:** A user-friendly library for building interactive web interfaces, allowing users to interact with the virtual assistant via the browser.

4. **Speech-to-Text (STT):** An STT service like Google Cloud Speech-to-Text or Mozilla DeepSpeech to convert voice input to text.

5. **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** A TTS service like Google Text-to-Speech or pyttsx3 to convert text responses to spoken audio.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Install Dependencies:** Install the required Python libraries specified in the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Set Up Gradio:** Install Gradio and check its documentation for any additional setup.

```bash
pip install gradio
```

4. **OpenAI API Setup:** Obtain an API key from OpenAI and set it up by following the instructions in the OpenAI documentation.

5. **Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) Setup:** Set up the chosen STT and TTS services. Ensure they are accessible through appropriate API credentials.

6. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:** Launch the Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells to run the virtual assistant.

## Usage

1. **Web Interface:** After running the Jupyter Notebook, a web interface will be accessible at a local URL (e.g., `http://localhost:7860`). Users can open this URL in their web browser to interact with the virtual assistant.

2. **Voice Input (STT):** The web interface will have a button or option to enable voice input. Users can click the button and speak their queries, which will be converted to text using the STT service.

3. **Text Input:** Users can also interact with the virtual assistant by typing their queries directly into the text input field.

4. **Chatbot Response:** Once the user submits a query, the virtual assistant (powered by the ChatGPT API) will process the input and generate a response.

5. **Voice Output (TTS):** The response generated by the chatbot will be presented as text on the web interface. Additionally, users can choose to hear the response by clicking a button to enable the TTS service.

## Acknowledgments

This project leverages the power of the OpenAI ChatGPT API, Gradio, and Speech-to-Text/Text-to-Speech services to create a versatile and interactive virtual assistant. Special thanks to the respective developers and communities for providing these useful tools and services.

## Disclaimer

The virtual assistant's performance heavily relies on the quality and capabilities of the underlying services (ChatGPT API, STT, and TTS). The system might not be perfect and may have limitations in understanding certain queries or generating optimal responses. Users are encouraged to try different queries and interactions to explore the assistant's capabilities.
